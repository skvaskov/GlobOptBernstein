Constrained Global Optimization Using Bernstein Algorithm

Insturction: This file defines a Bernstein Algorithm solver class and all the cuda kernel functions that it needs.

Basic Introduction to the data structure and its motivation:
To make the data as 'parallelized' as possible, The Bernstein coefficients are not stored in any order.
As a result, additional to the data sturture storing the Bernstein coefficients, we need another array to store the 'position' of this patch
inside the variable space, so that we are able to compute the solution corresponding with a specific patch.
For the Bernstein algorithm, the 'position' is represented by a box \{(x_1,...,x_m) \in R^m | 0<=a_i<=x_i<=b_i<=1, i=1,...,m\}
This 'position' array will, hence, be performed with exactly the same operation together with the data sturture storing the Bernstein coefficients.
In general, we define a unit to be a union of the following elements:
	 1. a set of integers indicating the position (box) in variable space
	 2. Bernstein coefficients of the problem polynomial over that box
	 3. Bernstein coefficients of the inequality constraint polynomials over that box
	 4. Bernstein coefficients of the equality constraint polynomials over that box
	 5. lower and upper bound of the problem polynomial over that box (computed from 2.)
	 6. Relevant flags labelling the feasibility of that box (computed from 3. and 4.)
All the information is promised to be stored in the same index in no matter which data structure.

			To be more exact, the patches needed to be eliminated will be replaced by the patches needed to be saved

			Example: 
			[info for 1 st unit, info for 2 nd unit, info for 3 rd unit, info for 4 th unit, info for 5 th unit, info for 6 th unit, info for 7 th unit]
			 eliminate 1st       save 1st            eliminate 2nd       save 2nd            save 3rd            eliminate 3rd       save 4th

			 save 4th            save 1st            save 3rd            save 2nd

			The patches needed to be saved remain at their original position. And The patches need to be eliminated will be replaced by saved patches.
			In that way, elimination can be performed parallizedly. And that's why we need another array to store the interval where the patches lie in.
